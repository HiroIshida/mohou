## mohou [![CI](https://github.com/HiroIshida/mohou/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HiroIshida/mohou/actions/workflows/test.yaml) [![PypI Auto Release](https://github.com/HiroIshida/mohou/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HiroIshida/mohou/actions/workflows/release.yaml) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/mohou.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/mohou/)

This package implements conv-autoencoder based visuo-motor imitation learning using pytorch. This package focuses on extensibility. One can define custom data types (vector, image and composite-image) and also map/inverse from these custom types to feature vector that fed into the LSTM. Alongside the imitation learning framework, this package provides two demo using pybullet and rlbench. 

Please try [kinematic pybullet demo](/pipeline/pybullet_demo.sh) and [dynamic rlbench demo](/pipeline/rlbench_demo.sh). The results of demo is available on [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wzEk4u3B0LvvErki3E-zifUqgtZoqVxF).

one of result of applying this framework to rlbench's task

## Instllation
```
git clone https://github.com/HiroIshida/mohou.git
cd mohou
pip install -e . 
```
After this pip install you are readly to start [pybullet demo](/pipeline/pybullet_demo.sh)! However, to run [rlbench_demo](/pipeline/rlbench_demo.sh), there is an additional step of rlbench installation. See https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench for rlbench installation. 

## Contribution
When you make a new PR, one need to check that the tests passed and formatting is correct.

### testing
The test for `mohou` software is 3 steps: 1) static type check by mypy, 2) unit test by pytest and 3) integration test.
To running these test, you need install `mypy` and `pytest` by
```
pip3 install pytest mypy  # or use --user option 
```
Then, do the following
```bash
mypy .
pytest -v -s
bash ./pipeline/test.sh
```
### formatting
`mohou` code follows [black](https://github.com/psf/black) standard style. Additionally, we use isort and flake8 to check if the code is following pep standard. Basically, what you have to do for formatting is running 
```
./format.sh
```
(If this command is not sufficient to pass the lint test in CI, please send me a PR)

Note that to run the command you need to install packages
```
pip3 install black isort flake8 autoflake
```

right: testing sample (`~/.mohou/pybullet_reaching_RGBD/feedback_simulation.gif`)

Running [`pipeline/pybullet_demo.sh`](/pipeline/pybullet_demo.sh) is a good first step. 

An important concept of this framework is a "project", where all data, learned models, result visualizations and logs are stored in a project directory `~/.mohou/{project_name}`. For example, after running `demo_batch RGBD` in [`pipeline/pybullet_demo.sh`](/pipeline/pybullet_demo.sh), we can confirm that following directly structure is created under the corresponding project directory.

<summary> detail of each component of demo.sh </summary>

- `kuka_reaching.py` creates `MultiEpisodeChunk.pkl` which consists of `n` sample trajectories that reaches to the box in the image (stored in `~/.mohou/{project_name}/). The datachunk consists of sequences of `RGBImage` and `DepthImage` and `AngleVector`. Also, one of the trajectory image in the chunk is visualized as `~/.mohou/{project_name}/sample.gif`.

- `train_autoencoder.py` trains an autoencoder of `$image_type`. $image_type can either be `RGBImange`, `DepthImage` or `RGBDImage`. The train cache is stored as `~/.mohou/{project_name}/TrainCache-AutoEncoder-{uuid}.pkl`.

- `visualize_autoencoder_result.py` visualize the comparison of original and reconstructed image by the autoencoder (stored in `~/.mohou/{project_name}/autoencoder_result/)`. This visualization is useful for debugging/tunning, especially to determine the train epoch of autoencoder if needed.

- `train_lstm.py` trains and lstm that propagate vectors concated by feature vector compressed by the trained autoencoder and `AngleVector`. Note that `train_autoencoder.py` must be run beforehand. The train cache is stored as `~/.mohou/{project_name}/TrainCache-LSTM-{uuid}.pkl`. When you run `train_lstm.py` multiple times, the train caches are stored with different uuids, and when loading the one with least validation score will be loaded among them.

- `visualize_lstm_result.py` visualizes the `n` step prediction given 10 images, which can be used for debugging/tuning or determining the good training epoch of the lstm training. The gif file is stored as `~/.mohou/{project_name}/lstm_result/result.gif`

- `visualize_train_history.py` visualizes the training history (test and validation loss) for all train caches in the project directory. The figures will be stored in `~/.mohou/{project_name}/train_history/`

- `kuka_reaching.py --fedback` simualte the visuo-motor reaching task in the simulator using trained autoencoder and lstm. The visualization of the simulation is stored as `~/.mohou/{project_name}/feedback_simulation.gif`.

Also note that logs by `train_autoencoder.py` and `train_lstm.py` will be stored in `~/.mohou/{project_name}/log/`.

## Applying to your own project
Besides parameter/training epoch tuning, to applyig this software to your own project you must replace 
- `kuka_reaching.py` (data collection) by your own data creation program using real robot (or simulated model)
- `kuka_reaching.py --feedback` (execution) by real robot execution program
among the `pipeline/demo.sh`.

### Data collection
Typical data collection code looks like the following, where `AngleVector`, `RGBImage` and `DepthImage` are stored here but any combination of `ElementBase`'s subtype (see mohou/types.py) such as `AngleVector` plus `RGBImage` or `AngleVector` plut `DepthImage` can be used. You can also define custom type see [this](https://github.com/HiroIshida/mohou#define-custom-element-type).

```python
import numpy as np

from mohou.types import (
    AngleVector,
    DepthImage,
    ElementSequence,
    EpisodeData,
    MultiEpisodeChunk,
    RGBImage,
)


def create_episode_data():
    n_step = 100
    rgb_seq = ElementSequence()
    depth_seq = ElementSequence()
    av_seq = ElementSequence()
    for _ in range(n_step):
        rgb = RGBImage(
            np.random.randint(0, 255, (224, 224, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
        )  # replace this by actual data
        depth = DepthImage(np.random.randn(224, 224, 1))  # replace this by actual data
        av = AngleVector(np.random.randn(7))  # replace this by actual data

        rgb_seq.append(rgb)
        depth_seq.append(depth)
        av_seq.append(av)
    return EpisodeData.from_seq_list([rgb_seq, depth_seq, av_seq])


n_episode = 20
data_list = [create_episode_data() for _ in range(n_episode)]
chunk = MultiEpisodeChunk.from_data_list(data_list)
chunk.dump("dummy_project")  # dumps to ~/.mohou/dummy_project/MultiEpisodeChunk.pkl
```

### Execution
Typical code for execution using learned propgatos is as follows. Note that type-hinting here is just for explanation and not necessarily required.
```python
from mohou.default import create_default_propagator
from mohou.propagator import Propagator
from mohou.types import AngleVector, ElementDict, RGBImage

# Please change project_name and n_angle_vector
propagator: Propagator = create_default_propagator("your_project_name")

while True:
    # Observation using real/simulated robot
    rgb: RGBImage = obtain_rgb_image()  # define by yourself
    av: AngleVector = obtain_angle_vector()  # define by yourself
    elem_dict = ElementDict((rgb, av))

    propagator.feed(elem_dict)

    # If your fed elem_dict contains RGBImage and AngleVector, then propagated
    # elem_dict_pred also has RGBImage and AngleVector
    elem_dict_pred: ElementDict = propagator.predict(n_prop=1)[0]

    # Get specific element
    rgb_pred = elem_dict_pred[AngleVector]
    av_pred = elem_dict_pred[RGBImage]

    # send command
    send_next_angle_vector(av_pred)  # define by yourself
```

## Define custom element type
The following figure show the type hierarchy. In this framework, only the leaf types (filled by grey) can be instantiated. In most case, users would create custom type by inheriting from either `CompositeImageBase`, or `VectorBase` or `PrimitiveImageBase`. For the detail, please refere to [`mohou/types.py`](/mohou/types.py) for how the built-in concrete types such as `RGBDImage`, `RGBImage` and `AngleVector` are defined.

## Define custom embedder
`Embedder` in this framework is to embed `element: ElementBase` to 1-dim `np.ndarray`. For example, the built-in embedder `ImageEmbedder` equipped with a map from an image to a vector and a map from a feature vector to an image.

You could define your custom embedder by inheriting `EmbedderBase` and define both methods:
- `_forward_impl(self, inp: ElementT) -> np.ndarray`
- `_backward_impl(self, inp: np.ndarray) -> ElementT`

For example, in the demo we create `ImageEmbedder` from `AutoEncoder` instance, but you could use PCA or other dimension reduction methods.
